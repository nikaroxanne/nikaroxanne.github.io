it was an addiction, of course, 
carbon fiber bodies and chrome furniture 
and upholstery to match your mood

It was an iteration of yourself and you as a somebody -
,  a somebody else


,
You wanted it to be you and not
it was already the Google Glasses
The VR headset, the console, the microchip 
in your head, (yes, that's why the name
is funny: black mirror of that glass
-- mined from somewhere abstracted --
to make you ugly, before the filters)
you were already there
there was already somewhere else

There was no there there, here
But there was a there there, in there
