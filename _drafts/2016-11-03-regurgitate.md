title: regurgitate
---

I used to not know the meaning
of the word in a physical sense
in a clutch your sides
until the pain will release
sort of sense

I am the cow 
with four stomachs
no five
regurgitation on continuum

Then how dare you to say to me
my own words
you regurgitating them back
as though you had reached into my body
stolen a stomach
digested my writing
vomited it towards me
as though you
a child, so proud,
had discovered gold
in a sandbox
in a vat of acid.


My body sends itself back to me in a cardboard box
sheltered from the rain
I’m sorry
I say to my body
it does not respond
if it could speak
it would say
“mute”
