I’m looking at you and/or  
I’m looking at the ocean  
And if I am praying it is  
in a panic, or a rush to say  
all that I need to in this breath before  
I am looking at you and it is  
An exclusive or, XOR   
The objects where everything is  
An object, because it is functional   
This style of programming   
And everything is first-class  
Are you exclusive are we  
first-class or higher-order  
I am looking at the highest order and saying  
all that I need to in this breath before  
the manifestation of the thing I pray for most  
such that I am looking at you and you  
are looking at me
exclusively
