title: instructions for destruction
---

Triangulations create by destroying: a decomposition renders a composition; a maximal planar subdivision, always recursing on smaller and smaller parts is how I see.

I want to be in that delicate state between obliteration and perfect rendition. There, a self-portrait: the artist as the snake forever chasing its own tail while the numbers on the scoreboard tick forever upwards into some infinite positive space of enumeration. I was erasing too much before now, and now I need to erase. Too many lines to etch out the form of the body, watch me search for bone under flesh. Watch me always calculating the sums as I perform the algorithm for skeletonization. Watch me as I destroy myself on a loop forever. Watch me as I scratch scratch scratch the paper with the needle edge of a pen, always trying to scrape away rather than add. Watch me as I draw the portrait of my worst desire and then cover the lines of his face with a folded paper screen. Origami is always more about condensing than expanding, is it not? A very gentle beating of a flat shape into more, or less. 

My knuckles were bleeding on all my triangular strips of paper as I pinned them to the walls. My hands were shaking and I am always late for everything important in my life but I will peel back layer after layer of skin in search of some form of myself approaching a perfected normal. I told the four people sitting in chairs, watching me drip A+ all over the carpet, “pretend that this is a performance and that this a simply a part of the spectacle of this presentation.” I don’t know if it is a lie to tell someone to pretend when I am not pretending. I don’t want you to pretend. I want you to see it for what it is: a performance. Every movement of my body  is conducted as an increment in the algorithm to make you watch me and read from the script that returns the desired value to me: not very good but excellent.
