Edges are relationships and mental has become physical. 
I keep waiting for my body to crack. 
I keep avoiding asking the doctor for an MRI because why would I triangulate a line that should not be there add it to the list of edges add it to a growing collection {dataset class: Private:} is this meant to elucidate illuminate turn the lights down I’m on the verge of vomiting on the verge of committing acts of treason acts 3 part play like a triangle curtain falls and lifts and never touches the floor when you’re changing scenes and maybe that’s what I want to front that I am lifting the curtain but to evade evict curtail trade in this body these movements these ways I connect point to point to point to pain on a scale of 1 to ten is not linear time, polynomial growth (NP Hard NP Soft NP killing me softly) forever and ever in an arc which is really a collections of lines visual trickery optical illusion delusion hallucination that I would send you an email and then didn’t because I’m still working on the implementation invocation a call to the function to exit exit exit and the control flow is broken pipe missed a space missed a synapse missed the synopsis because I was late I’m sorry always for being late always for making you stay late always making you stay late just to talk once more about the relationships of the spaces between
