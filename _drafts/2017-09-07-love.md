love

I met you in the winter of my eighteenth year. It was in anticipation of a puzzle call sudoku they've been bankrupted. There was never anyone like you anyone to feel like a miracle every moment folding time like origami to condense and incandescence becomes a memory only fluorescent faint blue humming forever soft to blind gently.
