I see pictures of the place I used to live and I touch it like kissing lips through cellophane. There are mountains that are notmountains and grass that is notgrass and somehow the landscape is more real in the picture than it ever was when my body was a part of it. Dissociation of space but I want it to feel present I want the jagged edge of granite to be pressing into my skin -- not deeply enough to draw blood but just enough to feel awake.

I miss the photograph of my former home. I miss the National Geographic cover story and the 8-page full color glossy photo spread. I miss postcards of the desert and gift shop keychains and scorpions frozen in snow globes in lollipops in refrigerator magnets.
