title: an algorithm to forget him
---

I.

take every memory you have of him and translate it as one singular mark on the page
Every memory can be any size or shape or line pattern 
but every memory only is allotted one line
Use lines of a different color to mark where you divide the marks along a median


II.

Recurse. Divide again.


III.

Divide again until every mark on the page is isolated into a box or a collection of lines
Use another color to connect each pair of adjacent memories

Use a bichromatic pairing system
Divise your own rules for the system
Tell no one the rules

Once every memory is linked to at least one other memory, you will have a kd-minimum spanning tree of memories


IV. 

Spend one hour looking at the tree 
Cry because it is beautiful in an uncertain and ugly and hopeless way. 
It is beautiful in the way that a broken window pane is beautiful
Do not let anyone see you crying while you are observing this tree. This is a solitary pairing.


V.

Go to an empty space: a field, an abandoned building, an empty parking lot, 
anywhere where no one will cross your path for a stretch of time that is no less than 30 minutes 


VI. 

Lay the tree drawing on the ground and light it on fire

Watch as every leaf in the tree incinerates

This is how he leaves you
This is how you let him leave you
This is how you free yourself of him


VII. 

Watch as the entire tree turns to black dust on the ground.
Let the wind blow the dust away.
If there is no wind, pick up the dust with your hands and scatter it in far edges of this space (far is to be determined as you see fit, depending on your physical capacity at this point)


VIII. 

Once the dust has been moved and shifted and rearranged, and once you feel certain that it is finished burning and will continue to burn no longer, turn and walk away from the space and do not look back at it.


IX.

Go home and wash your hands.


X.

Make a painting with your clean hands 
Use whatever medium you want, including air
Let the painting be of something you feel in the space where you are right now: 
your bedsheets, a wooden table, a water glass, your body


XI.

Do not connect this painting to anything
Turn the painting around if you need to, 


XII. 
Keep the painting for three days and then decide
whether you want to burn it or hang it up or paint over it or give it to a friend.


XIII.
Wash your hands again.
