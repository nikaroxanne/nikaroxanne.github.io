it was better and now it is worse and things like to repeat themselves like I like to repeat myself
(why? it’s a mantra it’s a way of calming down everything is so loud so busy so everywhere all at once and if I repeat it eventually the it becomes the only thing eventually eventually)

wondering sometimes at night if I am hallucinating my hallucinations. are there maggots in my food or is that psychosomatic again? an external manifestation of internal dread. “existence before essence” I fear may be the death of me; create to destroy to create and tell me where is the self I seek tell me how many layers must I burn peel back eviscerate before I feel calm before I feel that my flesh isn’t trying to rip itself from me?

tell me if I imagining it all again. tell me I am a liar because even still it is your voice in my head. I can’t assemble the logic for why I would have lied in childhood but you seemed to draw a modular architecture, control flow was Turing complete so of course I was a liar. a child cannot know the truth. you ensured that.

repeat it repeat the memory say it to yourself over again it happened it happened it happened and if you say it enough times then maybe it won’t flee from fear but it will stay and you can have some device as witness some morsel to tide you over while you wait in the lobby wait in the car in the parking garage wait in the boathouse wait wait wait forever to hear what you won’t which is, of course, i’m sorry
