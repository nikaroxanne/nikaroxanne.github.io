title: I go out at night and act my age
---

What a peculiar behavior but I insist  
because my peers insist (they don’t,  
they don’t even recognize me, nor I them)  
because my mother insists  
because I insist  
ask myself to repeat

Remember last year when I slipped  
into a coma of nostalgia asked myself  
to remember myself from three years prior  
asked myself to pretend  
and to feel, whatever it was  
that I felt when I met him,  
the first one before you.  
There were a lot of firsts and there were  
none, a discrete and non discrete value  
the continuous null pointer the constant  
remainder of 0

I slip into the mass of bodies and this is  
the familiar, an anonymity amidst many  
I can recognize and name vaguely but not  
in terms that you would deem palatable or  
acceptable for the final submission of the  
third draft of the paper  
so many iterations and you never responded to  
my inquiry, even to say no  
it haunts me in a way I can’t even say  
out loud not even to  
my mother, who tells me “go out and enjoy  
yourself, you never know what could happen”  
but I do and I did and I will  
repeat call myself call you into blank  
night air a blanket a curtain a monolith   
of space and substance and that discrete  
non discrete null terminator exit condition

I move and I smirk and I picture  
the dance floor as a Caravaggio painting,
you as the compositionally aligned focal point  
pointing to yourself (recursive) telling  
me I will never stop wanting  
you to be the only one as I step  
off the dance floor into the night into nothing to  
hold my hand as we smoke the mountain  
of cigarettes I have rolled and placed  
delicately in their Florence-origin holder to  
caress my cheek on the cruel April evening  
as every evening because it is
still you  
the only resort I return to oasis  
in the desert my tranquil stop  
on the metro, second to last on the line  
before nothing and you are  
always, watching me from the periphery of the room,   
smirking, bemused, asking me why I read the paper,  
why I had already read the paper,  
months ago. Here is the answer: I was looking  
for a way to reach you,  
to speak in a tongue you would yield to,  
to say, I give this up, this age for you  
are the only thing keeping me  
young and old and relatively   
neither. Not my age not yours
