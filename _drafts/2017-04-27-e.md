You felt like some piece of dust in my body
Something old something new
Do I get second chances? Tell me what I deserve of late

"He was pretty happy, lead a pretty good life, for a Marxist."

I would hold your hand in the neon graveyard outside of L.A.

I would hold your hand many many places but my nails I cut them short like a man's like a blacksmith who whispers to get metal to bend is that what you want in your palm? Callous not Cala Lilly.

Name your depression's origins and I'm sorry is your mantra you say to yourself like bending metal like the welding torch it is okay to disintegrate I promise that steel reseals on cooling and you will be someday but I cannot be your weathergirl so you will have to listen for the feeling. 

Temperature drops slow then quick. It is a feeling and a science (they are the same, that is the secret).

I thought the cough was seasonal but it's a perpetual allergy and my body will heave but eventually let me go. Let me go. Let me go.
