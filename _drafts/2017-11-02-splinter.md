I draw you a picture and then I veer  
though the intersection, left turn only  
on the red light  
I think I’m speeding to hit  
the lamppost, recurl my body  
reverse metamorphosis return  
to chrysalis, I’d like to feel warm
for once. Maybe   
all of my speech is involuntary  
lifted memories of grafts  
spliced off from your voice in the auditorium  
I hid in the Roman amphitheater  
(Called vomitorium) where I learned  
the practice of self-mutilation
self-medication for self preservation  
I want to preserve  
your voice like epiphany calling down  
from Mount Zion, earth, always the tail end of
an apostrophe, or a quotation, whichever   
you’d prefer — I 
can’t picture you 
having a preference   
for abbreviation but 
I wanted to hear 
a beat in your English and I 
am waiting for you to leave 
it, the language like 
a scorned lover. I 
have been tired of 
my mother tongue 
since I fell 
into it. A lifetime 
of exhaustion, remind me   
how you divide time evenly 
to find the median, in time equal 
to the size of   
the parcels of division.  
Remind me of what you
search for when you break
