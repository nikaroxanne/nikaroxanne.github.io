title: the website analytics told me things i cannot utter aloud
---

the website analytics told me you read my poems while in Brooklyn and it made me want to break my body into 1000 subdivisions, along the median line

I recurse enviously on my body, trying to replicate the mechanical elements of yours 

every time I see a triangle, you are the only person thing I can think of and it makes me want to start my biting nails again 

i recurse on my body while biting my nails 

i recurse on myself always always

i still think about your knee and whether you can feel the cold in your metal bones when the temperature drops.
