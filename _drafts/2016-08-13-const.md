title: Const
---

you are collapsing like
a broken balcony
or a widow’s peak
the architecture
not the hairline,
turning in on itself
upwards
falling up, Shel,
into sky.

ask me to be spontaneous
but don’t for then I’ll burn 
you where your entropy 
meets your vocal cords,
scraping across one another
dirty sex that returns hazard

const is a keyword that refers
to the thing on its left
except when there is nothing there
and then it doesn’t
don’t we all?

I like structure and
bones and metal and plate glass
and lines and grids
and repetition
and repetition
and repetition

you are collapsing
I’ll pass you by pointer
so I can manipulate
your value
return you as something
better, more ordered
less clean
singed into line.
