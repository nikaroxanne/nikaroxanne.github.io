Craft me one to suit  
my need for an acceptable standard  
deviation away from the mean away from  
my allotted level of self pity away from  
A quarantined value of a proprietary amount of care  
I could love   
You like I love triangles drawing   
them endlessly seeing them   
everywhere seeing you 
everywhere seeing you always   
on every face of every man who passes   
me in the street and sometimes at night I   
dream that we are walking   
around the neighbourhood near   
the Ourcq metro, together, not   
for any reason other   
than an attempt to map   
again -- show you how I plan   
memories, corrugate  
cardboard networks in my head   
triangle upon triangle upon  
triangle to find something worth starting  
from the beginning, the picture was noisy  
volume down, I de-crease the lines.  
Today my friend asked me   
if you and I were close and   
I stuttered
