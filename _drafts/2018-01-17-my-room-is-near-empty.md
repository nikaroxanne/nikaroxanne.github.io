title: my room is near-empty in an attempt to be always prepared to leave here
---


I make trips home with suitcases filled to their brim in a search for the comfort in the expense of empty space. My room is not anything but a room and I would picture myself here for as long as i would picture myself anywhere, which is to say never very long, never long enough to be so attached that I could mistake my veins for cracks in the plaster walls

I can’t keep track of how you have progressed as an ideal in my head but I will admit that I keep ghosts out of loneliness and a desire for something lost that never was, a desire for the table-read where you hit your mark, where your beats are parallel of whatever has been in my head for all these years 

I will only apologize to the ghost of you who I have manufactured, never to your person. You are, after all, the one who leaves and I hate that you perpetuate the tension — remember that the wire connecting points is ever more taut the greater the distance between them. I beg for slack but it will not be allocated.

I watched it on his face, that mirror image of myself as I remember that transfixedly staring is startling to the object of voyeurism.

I watched him watch me like he could not look away. Let me bottle that and keep that stare forever, in a glass jar on my nightstand, a stare that will hold me when I start awake from a dream that is nightmare. It hurts like withdrawal when I break into daylight and you evaporate.
