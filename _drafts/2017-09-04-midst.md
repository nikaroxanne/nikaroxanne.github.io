Midst

Happiness is Paris in Cesar's living room on the futon between you and Ollie -- despite the fact that I held hands with him and let you slip your hand around my waist and maybe that was a double entendre I should not have uttered -- even so the sun falls in early and I shut my eyes and there are no dreams but the waking one and I see you always etched on the faces of strangers and I'm sorry I was not awake when I was with you, six months of sleeping, or ten years of sleeping but now I am awake and I can see that something golden sewed itself into my skin that morning and I feel it now coming through the windows in my tiny room in my beautiful apartment with those exquisite hardwood floors. I see you taking my hand to spin me around, forever and ever, rolling a cigarette, moving slowly and slightly afraid and always always in love with the moment with the light with the shadows on your face.
