you make your way by looking out windows of speeding vehicles as you move yourself and your body in space, accelerate past whoever you were 15 minutes prior; there is a constant annihilation of the self, a destruction that breathes like a body at night clutched by insomnia.

I hesitate in writing the technical synopsis for I want it to be enough to make you see me in absolution. It has been lifelong, this habit of hiding details in patterns of shapes, of inserting slivers of desire into the calculations that render canonical forms.

I wait at the transportation center in a city whose name is of little importance to the problem. I picture myself in a tub of hot water, trying to scrub away the dead skin cells that always form too quickly in layers on my body; Iâ€™d like to thank my grandfather for many things, of which, psoriasis is not one. All my dermal layers are out of sync with my environment, telling me to peel myself away too quickly; the paper doll is only clinging to the background by a thin strip of tape; it is too easy to move my body from here to there. 

I picture myself in a tub of hot water, in a different city, an antique claw foot tub with brass faucets holds me in suspension. A human body is almost entirely water so why else would I always mold to fit my container? The Vitruvian man fits snugly into a square, equally well into a circle, yet the circle and square having different area in units squared, there must be a reconfiguration in his structure.

A dream has a form like molten lava; I have forgotten the name for the fourth state. I never retain any significant measure of time.
