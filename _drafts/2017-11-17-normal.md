Observations for reality  
Provide sources for rendering  
Every day a simulacrum ad infinum   
Always the picture never the essence  
Always representation of the thing and the   
Thing is on standby  
Reality is on a layover in Dallas   
in Vegas  
in Vancouver   
in your headset where you’re watching me  
Watching you watch porn watch the weather   
report watch the Dow   
watch the NASDAQ watch NASCAR  
watch yourself become yourself  
And your body wastes away behind  
(Before in front of? Prépositions have lost  
Favor here, it is hard to render   
three or four dimensions) the headset. 

Which bed do you fall asleep in, Plato?  
It’s three like the bears but there is no just right   
All wrong  
All tilted sideways and skewed   
The rendering always lagging a frame behind  
The image RGB always smiling with a split lip
