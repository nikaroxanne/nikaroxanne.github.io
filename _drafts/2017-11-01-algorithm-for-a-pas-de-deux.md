title: algorithm for a pas de deux
---

Point is a vertex and arched foot  
line of arms and line between 
voronoi is a tie-breaker algorithm 
as the fouett√© will tie-break the 
pirouette, body off the ground
2D points projected onto 3D space
to find the smallest enclosing perimeter
Always smallest
Always tighter tighter tighter than you
Holding ((a body) to not scream)
Holding (me to contain (myself))
relational aesthetics, body in body
A dual of itself
A skeleton holds its flesh
And its body is just marks on the floor
For the proximity graph, a record of 
how close we can step 
(to each other) before we are
Pas de deux
