At times I look at my body as though I am explaining art to a dead hare. Tell me, Beuys, was the iron around your foot enough for your daily nutrient quota? I’m a vegan and I fear I’m anemic. I’m deficient in more ways than one. You call me Persephone but you say the last two syllables as one and I feel like a mobile device from 2003, not the harbinger of seasonal shifts. I would forgive your English but it’s your only tongue; I have so many I feel like a chimera, or Medusa, snakes sprouting from teeth.
