I have been wondering lately how to divide my body and I think I have devised the algorithm for the task. If I wish to parcel out my bones, send them out by mail perhaps, then it’s rather easy. 

There was a division, I felt, when you found the median. My central axis was found, fractured. You continued proselytizing. It was easy; a continuous division into smaller and smaller parts. There was so much harmony in the geometric series, yet the series wasn’t harmonic. If I told you the joke, you would laugh. I’ve read your bio. I know your humour. 

You said that as long as we can remove a constant fraction of data every time, then we have won. There is nothing lost in destroying the data set as long as, after a finite number of iterations, we find what we are looking for. We divide our work in smaller and smaller pieces. Somehow, everything adds up to one. Isn’t that the poetry of division? Somehow, we return to one.

Now, when I find the median on this new data structure, I have to think about the repercussions. I have to think about the time I have thrown away in finding a small piece — a key to getting what I need to move forward. Every time I find the median, the time elapsed is so large it could swallow me. Yet, we only find the median once. We only are drowning for a moment, and then we resurface. And once our face breaks the water again and we are gasping for air we can call deletedeletedelete on so many things that it is dizzying. We can destroy everything in constant time. We can delete the structure as though it were never there.

The harmony — or perhaps I should say the geometry — of the swift and brutal action, is that it evens itself out. You find that crooked median once and then you can delete everything. Instead of time drowning you, time trickles out, slowly forming a puddle around your body as you lay on the cement floor. Time is barely an inch of water, not even coming up to cover your mouth. The dispersion of time has removed the inequality in its balance. It is level. It is pure. It is constant. We delete everything in constant time. Somehow, we return to one.

So that is how it is now. I find the center of my body, cracked; the operation takes so much time. But it only happens once. And then I iterate through and deletedeletedelete so many things that have made up my structure for so long. I delete them so fast I grow faint but do not stumble.

I destroy everything in an unforgiving efficiency; my body complies and unravels. And there I am, standing outside on a cool November night — completely deleted and completely free. Time has been amortized. In constant time, I have created myself anew. A perpetual action, I can amortize my creation, constantly.

I suppose I thought that the computer would do it for me. Though we can’t expect much from anything other than ourselves. But I know how it is done, now. I’ve read the papers. I followed along. I will write the algorithm for my own destruction. For even when the data structure is empty, it still contains a sentinel, a null pointer, a something leading to nothing. We flee ourselves and we are still here. 

I would ask you about leaving, for I have done so, over and over. I will divide my body a few more times before I beg the question. For I suppose the question is not, why did you delete yourself from there, but why did you reinsert yourself? I am not sure if that operation is amortized. I am not sure if going back to a deleted state keeps time constant.
 I will keep finding the median.
