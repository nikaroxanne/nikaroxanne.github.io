title: domestication
---


how would the headline read in French
(“study finds cats domesticated themselves”)
I had not considered the possibility of an outlier reflexive verb
it lends itself as though it was meant to bend back
“se domestiquer” as though creatures channel control like vacuums
pulling ourselves into ourselves

it is cyclical this auto-fixation
this self-fascination
this desire to front nature vs nurture
when always it has been
I mold myself to create myself

I have been leaving clues my whole life
for you to find me for you 
to tell me which way to bend
but it is simply backwards and towards
myself, towards a central axis, search the median
find my spine and align
to a set modicum of behavior
(comportement in french; not compartment
I will not sanction pieces of myself away)

how would you read me if
I told you I domesticated myself
