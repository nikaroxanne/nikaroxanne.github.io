Midnight boy

I am slow dancing with   
my black cat, the kitchen, midnight and  
the purr makes me feel human   
again, how many days since   
I've cried real tears? My heart will split
for all of the speechwriters, never 
given proper attribution of words 
in the history books. I know it was not JFK 
who spoke those words but perhaps it was   
a man from Spokane with a stammer and lackluster 
jawline; perhaps he was handsome; perhaps power 
corrupts and poetry cleanses but only after 
it has corrupted -- make dirty to make clean.   
I used to steal YuGiOh cards as a child,   
not for lack of finances but just to tarnish   
the experience of ownership. Dirty 
to beget clean. Poetry isn't   
clean but that quote is and it's a slick   
speech for a slick man with slick 
politics and a slick way to climb 
to the top. Perhaps it is a Kennedy 
quote after all; the slickest of them 
all: American Tragedy blood.
