It will start in your neck, gradual upwards stretch, like a bowl of molasses that defies gravity 
It will move and surround you from the base of your skull, upwards upwards and around to your temples, burrow into your eye sockets and now is the moment when vision starts to rattle

It will infect every part of you with an ache
Your jaw (moving worsens it, immobilizing it worsens it)
Your chest (always terrifying, always the fear of a heart attack, not an unlikely side effect from the pain medication)
Your spine(an initial span of the two top vertebrae—
Eventually it will find its way into the deepest lowest part of tailbone. It will hurt to sit, to bend.)
Legs
Knees
Shins

Hands
