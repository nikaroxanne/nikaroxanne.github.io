Sometimes at night I pretend that I can play your life backwards, run it  
into the past and rewind to a point of potential convalescence —  
Things diverge and converge at a rate that we can’t see but can feel  
Is that god  
—  
I have had the VHS of Cinema Paradiso for a year and I  
haven’t watched it because I am scared it   
won’t be as good as I need it to be
