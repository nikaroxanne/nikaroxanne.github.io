I forgot that compliments must
complement the impending death
of the nearest
star
as it edges its way to
ward us, fingers ready
to molest our
celestial bodies.
(delete delete delete
that line; I’m sorry I’m
triggering to myself).

I’m sorry I saw
that your poem was
about your father not
the inherent flaws of
capitalism, should’ve said
that it was about a 
different partiarchal body
should’ve burned the system
like a Parliament
(the cigarette not the building
I’m not a threat to the state
I promise I promise I promise).

I’d forgotten how to say 
my name backwards
as we sat
under the overpass 
of the interstate that
connects two bodies
two valleys
(not ours).

You say your relationship
with your father
is complicated, misaligned
a pothole-filled road under
construction
then forgotten.

I ask you to elaborate.
You evade.
