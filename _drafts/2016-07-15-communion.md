I’m shooting up heroin in the back
of this mansion and I hope you quite 
like who I’ve become.

My dreams are like rainbows glittering 
raindrops shards of color trying 
to burn

You kiss me with snake lips
wolf teeth and bee sting
I tell you don’t stop already 
you’re there.

Do you recall Sunday down fast
in the pulpit you tore off
the pages from their delicate
spines

I asked you for reasoning
you told me drink blood
so I take it
through my arms now, one drop
at a time.

Do you dream of Tuesday when quickly you
stole me into the thicket,
out of my mind?

Do you find Friday as painful
as Monday because through
every clock tick the mirror still
stands.

I’ll see you there Saturday as
we both stand and say nothing
and I’ll take my
communion right into my
veins.

I hope you like her, this
girl who I feel now in my skeletal
structure, my
place in the
pews.

I hope you
pull back her
hair and scream
quietly how badly
and madly
and sadly
you dreamed.

For I see it
evaporate like
rainbows post-mortem
into the sunlight
towards heaven’s
black gate.
