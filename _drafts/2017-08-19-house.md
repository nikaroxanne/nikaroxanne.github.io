House

We have lived in this house for a month and forever we have never lived in this house except always. I walk downstairs to light piercing stone off painted brick fireplace into parallelograms I remember how they have formed themselves somehow they have formed themselves from me through me. I lean against a wall and there is only ocean-heavy air to inhale and inhale. It has been five days without a cigarette and 10 days since I could see above water. Tell my consciousness to send me updates by courier. I can barely look at a screen. And yet I move in the house without lights on. I move without fear and it is home.
