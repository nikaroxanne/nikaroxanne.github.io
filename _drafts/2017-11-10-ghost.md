always an anticipation of
the return without the  
premonition. Anguish  
calls me from the train  
platform, waiting to board for  
the coast of not-here and you  
are a visitor always in  
your own life, like a moving  
picture of a picture and I   
trace your skull with my   
finger pads sliced open on   
a line crisped into a perfect sterile   
steel surface last Saturday, post   
concerts (plural, not an error; I   
double-check always before utterance of   
a parity. It is always less about what is    
there than what isn’t). she   
has allowed the ivories to infiltrate  
her poems and it   
is a benevolent inquisition    
this conquest I delay   
saying any words for fear   
of their being the wrong   
words so silence moves with   
me, like a phantom, always    
companion a backwards release for I  
have been speaking louder or   
trying   
but I still

I think of you always in a hum  
dull pain from the base of my neck  
searching upwards towards ascension  
like me always mobile into  
some cloud some iCloud some pretense    
of security in a satellite hovering    
about my own body like    
une voyeuse    
I cannot blame it    
I want it so I forgive

I wish my thoughts were paperweights  
so I could shatter them   
you are so delicate in my mind and    
it crippled me    
at night your voice like an anvil to  
glue me to the sheets it  
is not sleep paralysis but tell  
me an English translation for toska  
There is none so I loop

every day like a rising call of church bells you  
ask for the proof  
I cannot confirm or deny  
the induction led to  
my collusion  
non confirmation   
my confirmation  
hail Marys whisper between the lines  
to demand why I front such a religious propensity  
I thought god lived in trees until  
now. Or until tomorrow  
I will cling to the Rowan oak in  
the meadow by the schoolyard because he  
whispers to me ideas that never  
crumpled into boredom or acquiescence

He tells me I am alive and I say okay:

everyone on the train tries to decipher  
why I crinkle my brow when reading you  
explaining movements of lines to lines  
(Not lines)  
and it is only shapes on a page and I will  
draw pictures that map and remember  
how you moved from Plato to Champlain  
if you were here you could decipher  
the other side of the conversation  
but you already have  
I’ve moved the planes  
to a Euclidean present  
and I say softly  
but not as softly  
that my grandmother was a philosopher  
and she haunts me still in a way I won’t  
relinquish.
