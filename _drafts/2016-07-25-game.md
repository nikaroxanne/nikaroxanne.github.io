If I had to explain structure
I would faint
Fall through the windshield
Plate glass slicing platelets

Calcium whispered to me
last evening between sips
"give me your bones
you brittle brittle beast"
I coalesce from habit
from an addiction to dairy

If you told me
your favorite color
I would slice it
or splice it
into hexadecimal
return the value from keys

of RGB

not human
not feeling
not visual

The floorboards confess to me
their apologies, most sincere
and I believe them.
I faint.
