I would have loved you three years ago but I cannot anymore and it is only because I have realized I need the lights dimmer so the room is darker so I can burn more deeply

You tell me you quit smoking, you, 24 years old living with your parents again in their colossal home in Brooklyn, you with your crystal chandeliers and you want a congratulations you want a well done like a steak medium rare. felicitations\!\! 

I can’t say it. I should say I am proud of you but instead I am ashamed of you, you who have allowed america \(little a\) to corrupt you, you have taken her into your belly and digested those dogmas and said to yourself that it was time for a bowel movement it was time to take your dose of fiber in your morning pulp-free orange juice so that you could move the sludge out of your body

you, who are now more pure and less interesting. you asked me if I had drugs and I said I’d already gone through all the coke I had which was a lie but we both know you didn’t deserve any you didn’t deserve my planet when you were there crystal chandeliers deciding to be safe and a “writer” and “happy” and “content” and ordering your coffee with creams and sugars instead of tasting it cruel running through you, natural fiber, black lighter fluid to awaken you

you want me to call you strong but it is not an addiction, those packs of camels and marlboros and pall malls and american spirits it is sustenance when you are hungry and you realized that deep fried americana does nothing for satiety (there, now, is your explanation for the country’s obesity) a forever and ever and ever meal staring at the cathode rays listening to dan rather listening to bill cosby listening to whoever even speaks on the television these days who watches television these days 

nicotine is a crutch but it is not an addiction. you, hopped up on your 10k silicon-padded fantasies, hopped up on your designer meds and I know I am not guiltless because I take them too I take them all too I take them in and let them consume me and I let the drugs tell me who I am these days and it is all nice it is all nice it is all nice

sometimes I lie awake at night before the melatonin has kicked in and I wonder whether I am more or less myself on the medication; whether I am not me without my drugs without my daily milligrams to turn me into something productive something acceptable something american

I am not proud of you I am not proud of you I am not proud of you
but I forgive you. And I wish I could love you.
