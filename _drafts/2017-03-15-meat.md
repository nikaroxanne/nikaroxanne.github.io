meat packets of bone and muscle
a friend of a friend,
he’s going to Nantucket for a week
he needs two eight balls

the polo shirt was nice in the catalogue
you should have forgotten how to smoke
you should not have given out our address
you should not have come back

the subpoena arrived in the mail on Tuesday
tell the IRS to go fuck themselves
are you really not sitting down to eat dinner
he hasn’t been himself lately

you hardly touched your food
if you eat so much you’ll look fat at Kate’s wedding
I forgot how much I hate wedding season
her color palette is peach and ivory

what’s the main course at the reception
I did three lines before I got on the train
filet mignon
