					<p class="triangulation">A triangulation is a maximum planar subdivision - a breaking of a polygon or a point set into triangles. Segmentation of a larger space into manageable pieces allows for a myriad of complex operations ‚Äî point location (i.e. google maps), an optimized distribution of vantage points (i.e. art gallery guarding), or, in this case, the creation of a mesh of a face for computer graphics rendering.
					</p>

					<p class="triangulation"> As with all divisions of space, there exists a multiplicity of means to deconstruct a face. This project was commenced from an initial search for an optimal facial triangulation. 
					</p>

					<p class="triangulation"> What does it mean to have an optimal facial triangulation? In the context of this project, it is a fast yet reliant algorithm to render an accurate mapping of facial landmarks (eyes, ears, mouth and nose) for later processing. We can think of it this way ‚Äî in order to allow for persistance of a projected filter onto a face, the algorithm, for detection of landmarks and their subsequent division via relationship-denoting edges, must return a triangulation that is rooted in the variable nature of a facial construction. 
					</p>

					<p class="triangulation">A facial triangulation algorithm must detect facial landmarks and then triangulate that representative point set such that graphics mappings can be persistently implemented, irrespective of shifts in light, direction or background noise in the camera image capture.
					</p>

					<p class="triangulation">This project seeks to flesh out what is known as algorithmic transparency ‚Äî herein defined as a clear and meticulous dissection of the numerous steps of an algorithm, for the goal of elucidating the structure and decisions of a perhaps-opaque-seeming technology. In short, to allow a user to peek behind the wizard‚Äôs curtain.

					<h4> Why? </h4>
				</div>

				<div class = "content"> 
					<p class="triangulation">We delineate spaces without thinking. This is a way to think about how we create referential landmarks to ourselves and to other points. This is an exploration of space, divisions of space and the landmarks we forget to notice on the landscapes that we most frequently apotheosize and excoriate concurrently ‚Äî our own faces.</p>

				<p class="triangulation">To be able to generate filters, image manipulations on our bounding-box-designated face region, we will have to first locate the "landmark points" that make up a face. Landmark points can be understood as a very basic division of the face into eyes, ears, mouth and nose, but distilled to a few key coordinates for each. In a sense, a rather emoji-like rendering of your face is distilled from all of the information. Isn't it nice to know that you can be reduced to a post-human version of yourself faster than you can say ex-Machina?</p>

			<h3> Facial Landmarks </h3>
				<p class="triangulation">We want to determine ‚Äúfacial landmarks.‚Äù ‚Ä®There are several different libraries used commonly for Machine Learning related to facial detection/ recognition which rely on libraries of hand-drawn facial landmarks on ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù faces (this is perhaps playing into standards of Euro-centric standards of Western beauty and ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù facial structures ‚Äî an important point to note that I will not delve into here but which can be explored <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/04/the-underlying-bias-of-facial-recognition-systems/476991/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/28/joy-buolamwini-when-algorithms-are-racist-facial-recognition-bias">here</a> and more in-depth <a href = "https://www.ajlunited.org/">here</a> ).</p> 
			</div>

			<div class = "content">
				<p class="triangulation">These libraries (i.e. iBUG etc) use these input facial ‚Äúmaps‚Äù as a guide ‚Äî once interest points are detected, the generic 68-point mapping of facial landmarks can be used to refine and adjust the location of the landmarks on an input image. </p> 
			</div>

			<div class = "content">
				<p class="triangulation">Euclidean distances between detected interest points and the location of landmarks on inputted maps can verify or discard interest points until an approximate set of 68 points (or more or less, depending on the library) is determined.</p> 
			</div>

			<div class = "content">
				<p class="triangulation">For this visualization, I have chosen to forgo utilizing ML technologies and external libraries of facial landmarks for simplicity‚Äôs sake. In the narcissistic spirit of selfie-culture, I have used a singular image of my own face as a baseline. </p>

				<!--<p class="triangulation"> In the narcissistic spirit of selfie-culture, I have leaned closer and closer to the shimmering crystalline screen and will likely fall in, drown and become a flower of my own namesake (Nika has really cute Greek origins that align me closely with the inspiration for an athletic shoe company, so this prophetic mythological destiny is already pretty deterministically (O(nlogn)) fated) -- but someone has to bear the burden of being a suffering artist for the sake of computational geometry (let the spirit of Sylvia Plath guide me on this single-source-shortest-path towards my goal. </p> -->

			<div class="content">
				<p class="triangulation"> Using reference images from the 68-landmark-point model, I approximated this path on my face. This process strangely parallels the source material used in databases for these libraries -- I am using hand-drawn approximations to use as a comparative model. This is a rather naive, perhaps brute-force way of approximating facial features, but it accomplishes the task needed for this visualization ‚Äî which is simply, to make your face ‚ÄúCubist‚Äù via a triangulation mesh. </p>
