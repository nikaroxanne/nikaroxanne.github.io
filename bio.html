	<p>As a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, I am exploring computer science as a medium for artistic expression in the modern era. I spent my third year of university in Paris, where I studied at Université Paris I and III as well as L’école Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. I am currently a fifth-year student in the dual degree program at Tufts and the SMFA, where I am pursuing a triple major in Computer Science, French and Fine Arts. </p> 

	<p> I love language in all its messy and broken forms and work to combine programming languages and "natural language" in my daily artistic practice. I am bilingual in English and French and I sporadically study Spanish, Polish, Slovak and Russian. After spending the first half of this year in an informal reading group at the Harvard Kennedy School - entitled "Algorithmic Transparency - I am dedicating this final year of my studies to delving deeper into the structure, power and poetry of algorithms.</p>

	<p>This website serves as a portfolio for my visual artwork (painting, drawing, code-based works) as well as my writing portfolio (poetry and prose). </p>

	<p> Nika Korchok is a fifth-year student in the dual degree program at Tufts and the SMFA. She is a triple major, pursuing degrees in Computer Science and French at Tufts, and a BFA with a focus in drawing and printmaking at the SMFA. </p>

	<p> Nika is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States and is bilingual in English and French; she also studies Spanish, Polish, Slovak and Russian. She spent her third year of university in Paris, studying at Université Paris I and III, and L’école Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. </p>

	<p> Her work in an informal reading group at the Harvard Kennedy School -- entitled "Algorithmic Transparency” -- has informed much of her research practice related to the politics and ethics of software engineering. </p>

	<p> Utilizing traditional media and processes -- notably woodcut and observational drawing -- as a point of entry into the structure, power and poetry of algorithms, she is reimagining anatomy in the context of the instructional format of an algorithm. </p>
