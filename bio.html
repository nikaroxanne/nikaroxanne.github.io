	<p>As a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, I am exploring computer science as a medium for artistic expression in the modern era. I spent my third year of university in Paris, where I studied at Université Paris I and III as well as L’école Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts. I recently graduated from the dual degree program at Tufts and the SMFA, where I completed a triple major in Computer Science, French and Fine Arts. </p> 

	<p> I love language in all its messy and broken forms and work to combine programming languages and "natural language" in my daily artistic practice. I am bilingual in English and French and I sporadically study Spanish, Polish, Slovak and Russian.</p>

	<p>This website serves as a portfolio for my visual artwork (painting, drawing, code-based works) as well as my writing portfolio (poetry and prose), and it showcases the myriad ways in which I am delving deeper into the structure, power and poetry of algorithms. </p>
