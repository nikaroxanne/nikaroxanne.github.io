title: in a lyft between two parties I pretend I am holding your hand and talking about optimal decomposition
---


have you ever heard a rendition of welcome to the jungle on cellos? More times than I realize until this moment, I have dreamt of walking down the street in Manhattan to the philharmonic with you. We talk about harmonic and geometric series, about median finding, about linear time algorithms. We talk about where you grew up, about the way the streets look under different lights at different times of day. You do not let go of my hand, not even once. I know you are a dream to me, that I am André Breton, allowing you as Nadja to become the metaphorical distillation of an entire philosophical movement. And yet, I know you in some way that is more intimate than the general public, more than what is revealed before the curtain closes. An orator is simply a performer; am I wrong?

I’ve read the footnotes and the author’s note. I have read something delicate and personal and liable to break if clutched too tightly, which I will, there is no doubt of that.  
In that philharmonic dream, between adagios, I whisper to you that I feel everything with an intensity it often threatens to snap my body along a thousand median subdivisions.  
I will presume to like you yet how can a kd-tree love what divides it? How can a structure coerced by fracture presume to be infatuated by that which makes it break?
