Triptych 

A bucket list is a disgusting description of desire yet death walks with longing with interlaced fingers so the moniker is truthful. The boys at the parties I attend will sometimes trade stories like baseball cards and all of ours are gone but eBay is not an equivalence for joy so it is for the best. I walked into this suite two years ago and the people always change the people never change like the furniture, reconfigured but same framework same upholstery. Blonde boy tells brunette boy "never have I ever" and someone chugs a cheap shitty beer regardless of past participation in route activity. I call blonde boy from brunette boy's neighborhood and the action still feels like a mistake but desire is deadly kicking the bucket list.

There is hesitation in the response but there is always hesitation and desires revolve around polished words, not instinctual noise so the pause to hesitate is necessity.
