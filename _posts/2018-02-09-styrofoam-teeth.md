title: men will crunch their styrofoam teeth as they watch you walk past
---

they will crackle like off-brand cereal 66% off in aisle 13 (the e. coli scare has shook us all)
they will shiver like naked deciduous trees in winter; they will hunger for you with blood dripping from their jaws(their maws) as wolves with fresh-killed flesh still wedged between foot and dirt, always the hunger still for what cannot be hunted with ease
they will toss you dimes and then run —  
they will tie tin cans to your legs and then flee as you chime like a church bell
you, twinkle as a percussion instrument, you, are not a triangle to be struck with a metal blade in 3/4 time

you will try to teach them to walk barefoot in mud in the breath between April and May
they will dry heave with tears they cannot peel off like losing lottery tickets
you are not a powerball, called on Channel 4 at 7pm and then at 9pm and then at 11:30pm still, for the stragglers — desperation is a vice like a drug like a bad parent 

you make pauses in your speech that confuse them; they hunger for a regurgitation of rhythm in the club hit they can pretend to know and really do 
you shatter the floor 
you disintegrate them as an Altoid shimmers on a tongue, yearning for the cloak of cleanliness 
you are not mr. clean or pledge but you can swiffer them swifter than a sifter will shift flour from itself, a recursive breaking of something into itself and less, over and over and 

you will croak for them somehow as a toad mistakes a chlorine pool for the marsh that has been stolen from it, but you will find what is deserved of a creature with skin that soaks in all toxins and tells the earth a barometric report of its own poison

you will watch them sned trees that they once climbed, break branches of what once held them
you will let them pour ricin into their blood only because it is an elegant spectator sport, not gladiatorial but holy: crunching popcorn at a crucifixion

you will run into the valley, holy citadel to alert the ministry 
you will shine like cadmium red — a blood tint with a half life longer than yours
you will be a ghost as you live for you are what they cannot possess and for this they will try to exorcise you, rip you from your own skeleton, tame you in the way that breaking a horse is never a delicate procedure 

you will fool yourself into believing that you want those styrofoam teeth to French can-can into slick rows of nodding approval but they will never be your smiling Rockettes at Radio City

men will punch their keys and themselves and each other to a staccato that they have heard before but cannot place

men will reach always in the poorest form arabesque and you will be the danger that urges them to lean even further forward, to break their backs, to make them topple and collapse in front of the wall of mirrors that echo them back to themselves (a recursion again, but one with no exit condition: a runtime error)

and you, 
you are holy and sin and you are in limbo and in everything that cannot be touched 
you are the abstract syntax 
they will try a thousand times over to turn you into a concrete representation 
they will always fail
You are always less and more and 
you are madness
You
You you
You 
will recycle yourself always as a perfectly allocated segment in memory
and they will forever be stuck as the garbage that never melts in the landfill, not even after a thousand years
they are already a hollow crackling styrofoam symphony

you, perpetual recursion to resurrection
