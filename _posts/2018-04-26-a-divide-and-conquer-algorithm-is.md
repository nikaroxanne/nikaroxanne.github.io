first iteration, first instruction says to take the lump sum
Everything is in my arms and not you and I 
call my senators to tell them that they were wrong that you
were not the ivy-league messiah I was promised and that 
Ted Hughes didn’t write a goddamn poem 
worth remembering yet he is still in anthologies.
You are still cited in research papers and you
set fire to mine, used it as kindling and I
would still light myself on fire for you
would still search my body for the flammable edges and 
strike a match against my the flint of my human knee 
my human bones, my human flesh

I burn my hair so fucking often that I don’t even notice the smell 
anymore and this is the only dulling of my senses

first iteration, second instruction: break everything 
“It is just a method of alternative analysis”
there is the rainy day method and the accounting method and the potential method

an amortized cost is more of a bullshit rounding up or down 
of the value for which you have contorted 
your fingers around themselves (this is a posturing I know well)

you beg the numbers to lean one way or the other 
and they do because you have slid the abacus 
the right way? Or the wrong way, but the audience was distracted

this is expensive and it hurts but you wave your hands
“We will make up for it in the end”

First iteration, third instruction: glue it back together 
I can’t remember all of the pieces of my mother’s dishware that I broke
when I was younger, but I will assume that I can 
amortize it to 0.
I was never careless
I can count on my fingers and toes the number of objects I have broken 

I almost address the email to you 
Hesitate and shake so badly that my joints
Misalign themselves
I have my chiropractor on speed dial
(Another lie, I don’t remember when anyone was on speed dial. Maybe 2006?)
my body is the contorted abacus, accustomed to uneven sliding values

I saw you, see me, staring at your body and
wondering if you had read the one poem that is difficult to misinterpret 

Second iteration: a lie
A method of alternative analysis, you repeat 
with smaller and smaller pieces until you hit the base case
until you hit zero
until you die
